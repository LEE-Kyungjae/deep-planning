# DeepPlan Strategist Agent

This document captures the product-intelligence agent direction for DeepPlan.
It is based on the premise that a successful service is not only a problem and a solution.
It is a repeatable experience that converts desire, emotion, behavior, and timing into retention or revenue.

## Thesis

DeepPlan should not become a generic planning document generator.

The stronger product direction is:

- attack weak ideas before execution
- prevent LLM agents from producing average AI wrappers
- convert ideas into monetizable user experience loops
- use external behavior references as creative raw material
- generate non-generic directions by recombining reference patterns
- adapt critique to the user's repeated planning weaknesses
- enter an already-started project without assuming a clean slate
- preserve the planning state, evidence, and revision trail in DeepPlan

The strategist agent is the layer that turns this into an operating loop.

## Why A Strategist Role

Planner, researcher, and reviewer are necessary but not sufficient.

- `planner` keeps direction state coherent.
- `researcher` captures evidence and references.
- `reviewer` handles human review and restore decisions.
- `strategist` judges whether an idea has product force before anyone builds it.

The strategist asks:

- Is the problem narrow and painful enough?
- Is the solution actually matched to that problem?
- Which desire or emotion creates buying or returning behavior?
- Is there a real experience loop, not just a feature list?
- Where is the monetization moment?
- Is this another generic LLM-generated service?
- What external references produced the core insight?
- What ethical, trust, community, or regulatory risk comes from the emotional loop?

## Core Evaluation Frame

The strategist evaluates ideas through these axes:

| Axis | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Problem-Solution | Who has the problem, how painful is it, what current alternative exists, and why is this solution the right response? |
| Desire-Emotion | Which desire or emotion moves the user: fear, greed, control, status, belonging, envy, anger, relief, or achievement? |
| Experience Loop | What is the trigger, emotional state, action, reward, monetization moment, and return reason? |
| Monetization Trigger | What exact moment makes payment feel natural or urgent? |
| Anti-Generic | Is this just another AI dashboard, todo app, CRM, assistant, or productivity wrapper? |
| Reference-to-Insight | Which behavior data, papers, reviews, success cases, or failure cases created the insight? |
| Creative Recombination | Which transferable behavior principles can become non-obvious product directions? |
| Personal Profile | Which repeated planning weakness should the strategist compensate for next time? |
| Project Context | Is this a new project, mid-project rescue, pivot, or continuation decision? |
| Risk Boundary | Does the loop rely on exploitation, toxic conflict, resentment, or fragile trust? |

## Product Loop

The intended loop is:

```text
idea
  -> strategist evaluation
  -> reference discovery if evidence is weak
  -> plan update if the direction is sharp
  -> review request if the decision is risky
  -> build only after the idea survives the gate
```

The strategist does not replace DeepPlan's kernel.
It reads the current plan, produces a strategy report, and may request review.
It should not bypass host capabilities or mutate plan state directly.

## First AI-First Scaffold

The scaffold includes:

- role: `strategist`
- profile: `strategist_product`
- actions:
  - `evaluate_experience_strategy`
  - `generate_creative_directions`
- skills:
  - `problem-solution-pressure`
  - `desire-emotion-map`
  - `experience-loop-design`
  - `anti-generic-insight`
  - `reference-to-insight`
  - `creative-recombination`
  - `personal-planning-profile`
  - `mid-project-intake`

Build the AI prompt bundle locally:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src \
python3 -m deepplan_agents.console prompt \
  --payload-json '{"idea":"AI productivity dashboard","target_user":"solo builder","solution":"dashboard"}'
```

The host must inject an AI strategy provider before running `evaluate_experience_strategy`.
The strategist execution path should not fall back to rule-based scoring.
Deterministic code is allowed only for prompt construction, JSON schema validation, route validation, and provider mocks in tests.

Run with a real OpenAI provider:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
PYTHONPATH=scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src \
python3 -m deepplan_agents.console run \
  --role strategist \
  --action evaluate_experience_strategy \
  --provider openai
```

The default OpenAI model is `gpt-5.5`.
Set `--model` or `DEEPPLAN_OPENAI_MODEL` to override it.
The provider uses structured JSON output and validates the result against the local strategy report schema before the host consumes it.

For creative direction generation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src \
python3 -m deepplan_agents.console prompt \
  --action generate_creative_directions
```

This action is for zero-to-one ideation and mid-project rescue or pivot work.
It accepts `entry_mode`, `project_stage`, `existing_artifacts`, `current_plan`, `constraints`, `pivot_signals`, references, behavior signals, and a `personal_profile`.

Run creative direction generation with a real provider:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
PYTHONPATH=scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src \
python3 -m deepplan_agents.console run \
  --role strategist \
  --action generate_creative_directions \
  --provider openai
```

Expected behavior:

- generic service patterns are detected
- weak problem-solution structure is flagged
- missing emotional demand and repeat loop are called out
- missing evidence is converted into concrete research questions
- the agent proposes a sharper positioning rewrite
- monetization is tied to a specific trigger and emotional state
- negative emotional loops are surfaced as risk boundaries
- output recommends `revise_before_build` or `stop_and_research`

## Strategy Report Shape

The AI strategist must return a structured report with these fields:

- `overall_score`
- `decision`
- `axes`
- `emotion_drivers`
- `risk_boundaries`
- `generic_patterns`
- `missing_fields`
- `risks`
- `recommendations`
- `research_questions`
- `next_actions`
- `positioning_rewrite`
- `monetization_moment`
- `reference_insights`
- `creative_directions`
- `personal_profile_updates`
- `project_context`

The model owns judgment quality.
Hosts own deterministic validation of the report shape, next-action routes, and capability boundaries.

`reference_insights` is the key creativity bridge.
Each item converts a source into observed behavior, emotion driver, monetization moment, repeat loop, transferable principle, and application to the current plan.

`creative_directions` recombines those principles into non-generic product directions.
This is where DeepPlan should fight the common LLM failure mode of producing the same dashboard, assistant, todo, CRM, or productivity shell.

`personal_profile_updates` lets DeepPlan adapt over time to the user's planning pattern, such as repeatedly starting from implementation, skipping reference evidence, or overusing dashboard-shaped solutions.

`project_context` keeps DeepPlan useful after a project has already started.
Mid-project analysis should use current artifacts, constraints, traction, pivot signals, and sunk-cost pressure instead of pretending the user is at day zero.

`next_actions` is the bridge from judgment to execution.
The strategist does not execute actions directly.
It recommends host-understood actions such as:

- `update_plan` when an idea should be sharpened or preserved
- `capture_evidence_cycle` when research is required before build
- `request_review` when a risk boundary needs human judgment

Each next action includes:

- `target_role`: the agent role that should execute it
- `action`: the host action name
- `priority`: `low`, `medium`, or `high`
- `reason`
- `payload`

## AI Reasoning Contract

The scaffold includes a provider-neutral prompt bundle for the strategist:

- system prompt: `scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src/deepplan_agents/prompts/strategist-system.md`
- output schema: `scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src/deepplan_agents/schemas/strategy-report.schema.json`
- prompt builder: `scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src/deepplan_agents/strategy_prompt.py`
- provider boundary: `scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src/deepplan_agents/strategy_llm.py`

The prompt bundle includes:

- the idea payload
- the current DeepPlan snapshot
- the required JSON schema

Generate the prompt bundle without calling a model:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src \
python3 -m deepplan_agents.console prompt
```

This keeps provider integration separate from the product reasoning contract.
Any OpenAI, local model, or hosted agent adapter should preserve the same report shape.

The provider boundary is intentionally small:

```python
class StrategyLLMProvider(Protocol):
    def complete_json(self, *, messages, schema) -> dict:
        ...
```

That means a real adapter only needs to:

1. receive the prompt messages and report schema
2. call the model with structured JSON output
3. return a JSON object
4. let `run_strategy_llm` validate the report shape before the host consumes it

The scaffold includes a static provider only for tests and local contract checks.
It is a provider mock, not a product judgment fallback.

## Routing Next Actions

The scaffold also includes a route validator:

- route helper: `scaffolds/deepplan_agents/src/deepplan_agents/strategy_routes.py`
- console command: `deepplan-agents route`

It checks each `next_actions` item against the local host action contract.
For example, a `target_role` of `researcher` can receive `capture_evidence_cycle`, but a `reviewer` cannot receive `update_plan`.

This keeps LLM output useful without letting it bypass role capabilities.

## Design Rule

DeepPlan should not make the user feel that planning is paperwork.
It should make the user feel that weak ideas are being attacked before they waste build time.

The emotional promise of the product is:

- less anxiety about building the wrong thing
- more confidence that the direction has market and emotional force
- higher odds of finding non-generic service ideas
- a stronger sense of control over AI-driven execution
